\usage{
rao.diversity(comm, traits = NULL, phylodist = NULL, checkdata = TRUE,
  ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{comm}{Community data, with species as columns and sampling units as
rows. This matrix can contain either presence/absence or abundance data.}

\item{traits}{Matrix data of species described by traits, with traits as
columns and species as rows (optional).}

\item{phylodist}{Matrix containing phylogenetic distance between species
(optional).}

\item{checkdata}{Logical argument (TRUE or FALSE) to check if species
sequence in the community data follows the same order as the one in the
trait and in the phylodist matrices (Default checkdata = TRUE).}

\item{...}{Parameters for \code{\link{gowdis}} function.}
}
\value{
\item{Simpson}{Gini-Simpson index within each community (equivalent
to Rao quadratic entropy with null, crisp, similarities).} \item{FunRao}{Rao
quadratic entropy within each community, considering trait distance.}
\item{FunRedundancy}{Functional redundancy in each community.}
\item{PhyRao}{Rao quadratic entropy within each community, considering
phylogenetic distance.} \item{PhyRedundancy}{Phylogenetic redundancy in each
community.}
}
\description{
Calculates Rao's quadratic entropy, functional and phylogenetic redundancy.
}
\details{
Rao's quadratic entropy is a measure of diversity of ecological communities
defined by Rao (1982) and is based on the proportion of the abundance of
species present in a community and some measure of dissimilarity among them.
The dissimilarity range from 0 to 1 and is based on a set of specified
functional traits or in the phylogenetic dissimilarity.

For the trait data , the function calculates the square root of the
one-complement of Gower's similarity index, in order to have a dissimilarity
matrix with Euclidean metric properties. Gower's index ranges from 0 to 1
and can handle traits measured indifferent scales. When the species are
completely different in terms of their traits, Rao quadratic entropy is
equivalent to the Gini-Simpson index.

Functional redundancy is defined purely as the difference between species
diversity and Rao's quadratic entropy based on their functional
dissimilarity (de Bello et al. 2007). The same definition is used for
phylogenetic redundancy.

\note{
\strong{IMPORTANT}: The sequence species show up in community data
matrix MUST be the same as they show up in traits and phylodist matrices.
