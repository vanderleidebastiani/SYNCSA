\title{Function to obtain the partial matrix correlation between three matrices.}
\usage{
cor.matrix.partial(m1, m2, x, y, z, method = "pearson", dist = "euclidean",
  permutations = 999, norm = FALSE, na.rm = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{m1}{Matrix that multiplied by m2 results in the matrix x.}

\item{m2}{Matrix that when multiplied by m1 results in the matrix x. See
`details` below.}

\item{x}{Matrix obtained by multiplication of m1 and m2.}

\item{y}{Matrix that will be correlated with the matrix x.}

\item{z}{Matrix whose effect will be removed from the correlation between x
and y.}

\item{method}{Correlation method, as accepted by cor: "pearson", "spearman"
or "kendall".}

\item{dist}{Dissimilarity index, as accepted by vegdist: "manhattan",
"euclidean", "canberra", "bray", "kulczynski", "jaccard", "gower",
"altGower", "morisita", "horn", "mountford", "raup" , "binomial" or "chao".
However, some of these will not make sense in this case.}

\item{permutations}{Number of permutations in assessing significance.}

\item{norm}{Logical argument (TRUE or FALSE) to specify if x is standardized
within variables (Default norm = FALSE).}

\item{na.rm}{Logical argument (TRUE or FALSE) to specify if pairwise
deletion of missing observations when computing dissimilarities (Default
na.rm = FALSE).}
}
\value{
\item{Obs}{Correlation between matrices.} \item{p}{Significance
level based on permutations.}
}
\description{
Function to obtain the partial matrix correlation between three matrices,
similar to the function mantel.partial. The significance of the statistics
is evaluated differently from mantel.partial. For more details, see
\code{\link{syncsa}}.
}
\details{
The null model is based on permutations in the matrix m2, typically the
matrices B, U and Q.

Null model described by Pillar et al. (2009) and Pillar & Duarte (2010). For
more details on the matrices and the null model, see \code{\link{syncsa}}.
